# Agenda

- Why we use Docker
- Understanding containers, images, Dockerfiles, tags and registeris
- Configuring, running, listing and inspecting Docker containers
- Check the logs for a docker container
- Docker container networking
- Docker container storage
- Environment variables
- Building pushing Docker images
- Docker image examples
- Working with Docker compose
- Docker registeries and working with them
- Side car containers
- Kubernetes

# Containers: Key Concepts


- **Lightweight Instances:** Containers are lightweight and efficient, utilizing the host OS kernel and sharing resources to run multiple isolated instances.
- **Encapsulation:** Containers encapsulate applications and their dependencies, ensuring consistency and portability.
- **Isolation:** Containers provide process isolation, preventing conflicts between applications running on the same system.
- **Standalone Executables:** Containers are standalone executable packages containing everything needed to run a piece of software.
- **Scalability:** Containers enable easy scaling of applications by running multiple instances in a consistent environment.

# Are containers Virtual Machines?

## No

# Containers and Virtual Machines 


Virtualization Level:

- *Containers* : Virtualize only the operating system (OS) level, sharing the kernel with other containers on the same system.
- *VMs* : Virtualize the entire hardware, including CPU, memory, storage, and network, creating a complete virtual machine on top of the physical hardware.

---

# Containers and Virtual Machines 

Size and Resource Usage:

- *Containers* : Are lightweight and fast to start, taking up only megabytes of space. This allows more containers to run on the same hardware compared to VMs.
- *VMs* : Are heavier and slower to start, requiring gigabytes of space. This limits the number of VMs that can run on the same hardware.

---
# Containers and Virtual Machines 

Isolation:

- *Containers* : Share the host OS kernel, but have their own isolated file system, processes, and resources. This provides a good level of isolation, but security boundaries are not airtight.
- *VMs* : Have their own complete virtual hardware, providing stronger isolation and greater security guarantees compared to containers

---
# Containers and Virtual Machines 

Portability:

- *Containers* : are highly portable. They run consistently on any system with the container runtime installed, regardless of the underlying OS.
- *VMs* : are less portable. While portable across similar hardware, differences in hardware configuration can cause compatibility issues.

--- 
# Containers and Virtual Machines 

Use Cases:

- *Containers* : Ideal for microservices architecture, web applications, and other software requiring portability, efficiency, and scalability.
- *VMs* : Suitable for legacy applications, software requiring direct hardware access, and situations where strong isolation and security are paramount.

# What is Docker?

- Docker is an open-source platform for automating, deploying, and managing applications inside containers.
- Containers allow bundling applications and their dependencies into a single package, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- Docker enables lightweight, portable, and scalable application deployment.

# DevOps Matrix of Hell

#  Matrix of hell

To understand the matrix of hell, let us understand the following example, where we have two applications 
  - `max-hell-python-2.py` & 
  - `max-hell-python-3.py`, 
  
which are dependent on `Python 2.7` and `Python ~ 3.0` respectively.

# Why not a virtual machine 


---

## Key Concepts

- **Containers:** Lightweight, standalone, and executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software.

- **Images:** Templates for containers, providing a snapshot of a file system, application code, and runtime.

- **Docker Hub:** Centralized repository for sharing and distributing Docker images.

## How Docker Works

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile example
FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```
